Option automation system in June 2016.
Technical Overview.
<br>
The automation system allows you to control lighting, climate, conduct surveillance, supplement
protection system (GSM-alarm).
<br>
Is a network of devices - a client and a server.
Customers include controllers based on Arduino or ESP8266, they are used to control various
devices (buttons, sensors, actuators).
Server - is a single board computer Rasberry Pi for communication between clients and visualization software.
<hr>
The system works on the protocol MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) - a network protocol that runs over TCP / IP
developed at IBM. MQTT protocol allows customers to integrate not only within the local network, but also on the Internet.
Thus it is possible to combine objects located at different locations in a one system.
<br>
Visualization is a web-server is created Node.js platform.
It works in the web-browser on a computer or smartphone. It has a simple and intuitive interface.
voice control using Google Web Speech API.
The exchange of information between the server and the browser is on the WebSocket protocol.
This allows to see in real time the status of all sensors and actuators.
<hr>
Feature List:
Lighting: Turn off all lights by using relays or contactors, and dimming of incandescent lamps
LED lamps with dimmable 220-volt, dimmable 0-10 volt control.
<br>
Climate: proportional temperature control using electric heaters, electric
underfloor heating, or by means of valves for liquid heating. Air conditioning
via infrared.
<br>
Connected sensors: light, movement, leakage of water, temperature, humidity, reed switches, buttons, and so on.
<br>
Connecting to CCTV system: video recorders and IP-cameras support for HTTP MJPEG.
<br>
The system is suitable for private homes, apartments, small business facilities.
